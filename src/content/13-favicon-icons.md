### What's so good about Icons?

Icons are wonderful, easy ways to convey action to a user without having any text. A real world example of a good use of icons would be a television remote. Many people are familiar with the play/pause button, the power button, and the volumen button on a television remote. It's been conditioned into people's brains for many years now and it is universally accepted now. 

Another advantage of using icons is maintaining space. On a television remote, if the remote were to list out all of its buttons in plain text, the remote would be too big to hold in an average person's hand. Thus, it loses its usability. Brilliant designers aimed to use small icons instead to keep television remotes small and compact to fit in a person's hand, all the while conveying the information it needs to to its user. 

### The problem with Icons and Accessibility

With the introduction of icons also comes another layer of usability and implied user proficiency. Due to the nature of icons, there's a certain subset of users with impaired vision and/or hearing that have a harder time to decipher an icon's implied functionality. 

Going back to the television remote example, how is a blind person supposed to use a television remote? For another example, how is a blind person supposed to use an iPhone? The answer is with screen reader software that will read aloud each icon. Enter the world of technology accessibility. 

In web accessiblity, there are guidelines and standards for most user interactions on the web. [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) is a set of evolving web standards for creating accessible web content. It follows a version control process. Currently, the latest standard as of 03/04/2021 is [2.2 WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/).
