### What's so good about Icons?

Icons are wonderful, easy ways to convey action to a user without having any text. A real world example of a good use of icons would be a television remote. Many people are familiar with the play/pause button, the power button, and the volumen button on a television remote. It's been conditioned into people's brains for many years now and it is universally accepted now. 

Another advantage of using icons is maintaining space. On a television remote, if the remote were to list out all of its buttons in plain text, the remote would be too big to hold in an average person's hand. Thus, it loses its usability. Brilliant designers aimed to use small icons instead to keep television remotes small and compact to fit in a person's hand, all the while conveying the information it needs to to its user.
