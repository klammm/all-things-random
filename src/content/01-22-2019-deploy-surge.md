In this post, I will talk about:

* Deploying with Surge
* Hosting my website

### Deploying with Surge

__TLDR__: I deployed my Gatsby app by following the [Gatsby-Surge docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-to-surge/) and the [Official Surge docs](https://surge.sh/)

- My struggle with deployment. A lot is abstracted away nowadays


During my time learning about web development and programming in general, one topic that was always saved for the end of the course was deployment. Deployment was one area of the software engineering processes that I felt like I was not able to have granular control over. It troubled me and it still somewhat haunts me to this day, which is why I'm writing about deployment. Not all engineers truly understand it, and those savvy enough to understand deployment know that it's simple system network architecture. It's the same concept of how the internet works but being applied on a smaller scale.
Anyways, so what magic needs to happen to deploy your web app that you've—_I've really_— spent all your blood, sweat, tears, and stress over?

- how does the internet work in 2 sentences. servers need to make requests and responses and host your code/files


- Step by step procedure on how I deployed using surge 

### Hosting my website

__TLDR__: I used Namecheap and mapped my CNAME using surge and gatsby.


### Conclusion

And that's it!
