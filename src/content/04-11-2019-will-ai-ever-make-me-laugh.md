Artificial intelligence is less accurate than children at describing pictures or shapes. Humans have a level of creativity that intelligence can't match. But why is that? Is it suffice to say that even the most intelligent beings in this universe are bounded by human creativity or life's organic creativity? Machine versus Man. A soul versus data. What then are humans to machines and what then are machines to us humans?

Machines are tools. Absolute tools used to create, empower, and even embody someone's will. Yet, machines are not capable of producing or enacting their own independent will. Is it possible for machines to eventually develop their own will? To develop one's own will is directly correlated to the development of consciousness. Essentially, for a machine to think and feel on its own, consciousness is the key to unlocking willpower and emotion.
