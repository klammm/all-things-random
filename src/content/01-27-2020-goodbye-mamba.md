- Mamba mentality affected everyone in the world. Global impact on everyone that enjoyed sports. Sports community and esports community even(CS GO tournament competitors shouting "KOBE" when throwing or launching an in game grenade to signify Kobe's deadly accuracy). hard work ethic and genius IQ analysis and sheer competitive killer nature = global impact


- He stayed faithful to a team and a city in a league where players leave NBA teams all the time in search of something better. 

- For those who didn't watch basketball or followed sports, his reach was farther in that he would be so entertaining to watch that he was a generational amnbassador to the game of basketball. Even those who didn't watch Kobe, knew who Kobe was.

- Kobe hasn't reached his peak success yet since he was now enjoying his retirement and starting a career in film and teaching basketball. His analysis was world class and insightful.
